# Feedback --- Most common errors/ issues
- get more data
- respect guidelines (less than 2 pages, means 4 is bad!)
- spellchecker, ALWAYS!
- no jpg, no png from R/python figures. Export in pdf!!! [<img src="https://raw.github.com/bcharlier/HMMA238/master/Challenge/2020-2021/feedback/no_bitmap_please.png?sanitize=true" height="400">](https://raw.github.com/bcharlier/HMMA238/master/Challenge/2020-2021/no_bitmap_please.png?sanitize=true)
- the bike project was short (try to make it one file if possible)
- do not duplicate code (after copy pasting 3 times the same, stop and think!)
- PEP8 of course!
- train/test is tricky on dates. Read https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#time-series-split for instance, to master nested versions.
- testing the prediction on your own test/train sets would have been important to avoid being confident in your own predictions.
- Excel was forbidden by the way, it was a course on Python !


- Merge the two datasets from the challenge (code will be posted)
