# practicals

this is kind of a mix of what i learned about git so far from the course & from various sources on the internet.

the workflow.md file is a step by step guide for using git as a tool to work  with teammates on the same project.

this is a  first version and will probably be updated during the course.

students are welcome to contribute to it if desired  :)
